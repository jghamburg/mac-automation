# Explore Mac Automation  

With this project I want to explore different ways to automate my MacBookPro.  
Basically this will be hacks that hopefully will easy the tasks of a days work.  

## First Experiments  

Explore the use of Bunch by Brett Terpstra in combination with the SreamDek gadget by elgato. 
The basic idea behind this is to provide a setup procedure for multiple apps with the sngle push of a button. E.g. for setting up my daily routine of Java development I

* start intelliJ
* start iTerms
* start Sublime Text
* start Sublime Merge
* move the windows in the right layout on my two screens

Later on I like to add some basic music support by my favorite Rock groups from the 70s and 80s.
